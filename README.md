#  Command Injection Payload Reference

##  Overview
This project demonstrates practical **command injection payloads** for both Linux and Windows environments.  
Command injection is a serious vulnerability that occurs when user-controlled input is executed as part of a system command.  
Attackers can exploit it to run arbitrary commands, steal data, or pivot deeper into a system.  

The purpose of this repository is to provide a **reference list of payloads** that can be used in:
- Penetration testing engagements (authorized only)  
- Red team operations  
- Security research labs and CTFs  
- Vulnerability reproduction and testing  

Payloads are delivered through a simple Python script that allows you to select the target OS and view payloads specific to that platform.

 **Disclaimer:** This project is provided **for educational and authorized security testing purposes only**.  
Do **not** use these payloads against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.  
The author is **not responsible for misuse or illegal activity**.
